My High-Frequency Trading Model Project
I developed a high-frequency trading model designed to analyze and trade stocks with potential for profit. The project combines machine learning and algorithmic trading techniques.
Technical Components
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for stock prediction
C++ low-latency trading execution module
Python integration script
Data Processing
I used yfinance to collect stock data, preprocessing historical price information to calculate volatility. The volatility metrics serve as input for the CNN model.
Model Architecture
The CNN is a binary classification model that predicts stock profit potential over a 5-minute window. It includes:
4 dense layers with increasing neuron counts
Sigmoid activation in the output layer
Pre-trained weights stored in model_weights.h5
Trading Execution
I created a C++ module that:
Receives stock ticker symbols
Executes buy/sell orders based on CNN predictions
Aims to minimize trading latency
High Level System Design Architecture for Scaling
To scale up the system, I designed a high-level architecture with the following components:
Data Ingestion Layer:
Multiple data collectors to fetch real-time market data from various sources
Message queue (e.g., Apache Kafka) to handle high-volume data streams
Processing Layer:
Distributed computing framework (e.g., Apache Spark) for parallel data processing
GPU clusters for faster CNN model inference
Decision Engine:
Load-balanced servers running the CNN model
In-memory cache (e.g., Redis) for quick access to recent predictions
Execution Layer:
Multiple C++ execution modules deployed across different exchanges
Load balancer to distribute trading requests
Monitoring and Logging:
Real-time monitoring system (e.g., Prometheus)
Centralized logging (e.g., ELK stack) for system health and performance tracking
Backup and Recovery:
Redundant systems and data backups
Failover mechanisms for critical components
This architecture aims to improve throughput, reduce latency, and enhance system reliability for high-frequency trading at scale.
